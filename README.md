## Features
* Simple app for tracking year progress
* Nice widget is included
* Built with SwiftUI

## How to build
- Clone repo and open Xcode project
- Update signing settings and make sure AppGroups entitlement is configured properly so main app can share data with widget
- Update `suiteName` in `SettingsManager.swift` to match with your AppGroup
- Build and run on your device or simulator!

## TODO
- [ ] Also track weeks and months
- [ ] Support for multiple trackers at once (both in main app and widget)
- [ ] Create custom color schemes

## Developer
This app was created by Maxim Skryabin as a simple pet project and a way to practice SwiftUI skills. You can download it for free from App Store or build it by yourself and customize. Feel free to contact me using <a href="https://mxm.codes/contact-en/">my website</a>.
